# Hill Safari 

- A Fully Responsive Static Website for promoting tourism hills like Uttrakhand

- Pack your bags. Weâ€™re going on vacation!

Thatâ€™s exactly what an effective travel website should make you feel. It should activate the travel bug with vibrant imagery and vivid copy. And while photos can do a lot of the work in inspiring visitors, a travel site canâ€™t accomplish its purpose without great web design.

Web design plays a major role in visitorsâ€™ first impressions of a business. In fact, in one study, when participants were asked why they distrusted a website, 94% of the comments were about design.

# Description
- The website is made fully responsive without using any framework!

- Applied all css knowledge without using grids and flexbox.
