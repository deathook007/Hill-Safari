- Pack your bags. Weâ€™re going on vacation!

- Thatâ€™s exactly what an effective travel website should make you feel. It should activate the travel bug with vibrant imagery and vivid copy. And while photos can do a lot of the work in inspiring visitors, a travel site canâ€™t accomplish its purpose without great web design.

- Web design plays a major role in visitorsâ€™ first impressions of a business. In fact, in one study, when participants were asked why they distrusted a website, 94% of the comments were about design.

## Overview 
- The website is made fully responsive without using any framework!

- Applied all css knowledge without using grids and flexbox. Only hard cooded css3 with sass and html5 with beautifull animations.

- The complete advance css properties to showcase the skills and deep understanding of css3 and npm to reduce size and complexity.

## Common Practices Used

- Advance css3 properties with organised syntax.

- More the comments easier the code to understand.
