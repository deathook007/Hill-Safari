- A <b>Fully Responsive</b> static landing page for promoting tourism in the hills.

- Pack your bags. <b>Weâ€™re going on vacation</b>!

##### Thatâ€™s exactly what an effective travel website should make you feel. 
It should activate the travel bug with vibrant imagery and vivid copy. And while photos can do a lot of the work in inspiring visitors, a travel site canâ€™t accomplish its purpose without great web design.

- The website is made fully responsive <b>without using any framework in first place.</b>

- Pure basis CSS3 and SCSS is used for learning purpose.

- No fluid layout used for responsiveness like grids and flexbox.
