Pack your bags. We’re going on vacation!

That’s exactly what an effective travel website should make you feel. It should activate the travel bug with vibrant imagery and vivid copy.

And while photos can do a lot of the work in inspiring visitors, a travel site can’t accomplish its purpose without great web design.

Web design plays a major role in visitors’ first impressions of a business. In fact, in one study, when participants were asked why they distrusted a website, 94% of the comments were about design.
